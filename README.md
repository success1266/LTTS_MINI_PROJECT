# About Project

Player management system is a free c mini project. This project helps the authority to manage their newcomer players. Talking about the project here, the user can manage their player profiles. He can search and update them. Also, this project helps in mitigating the risk of data loss. Whenever you save a player record it will be automatically added to the database in text format.

## INTRODUCTION TO THE INDIA PREMIER LEAGUE (IPL) :

Indian Premier League (IPL) is a famous cricket league that bids players to play domestic cricket in the country and encourage young and talented players. The new players though talented didn’t have a platform to showcase their achievements and get into the franchises. The BCCI (Indian cricket board) came up with a plan of building a website portal for the players to enter their details. The BCCI president Mr. Saurav Ganguly asked you to create a model class so that using your model class and the details, the web developers can get the data and feed them into their databases. So without any delay, let’s start working on our project.

### The franchises in IPL are:

Sun Risers Hyderabad (SRH)
Chennai Super Kings (CSK)
Mumbai Indians (MI)
Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB)
Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)
Rajasthan Royals (RR)
Delhi Capitals (DC)
Kings XI Punjab (KXIP)
