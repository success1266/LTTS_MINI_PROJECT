## Benefits of Project

1. Simple & Easy to Use
2. Easy to access 
3. Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable
4. Mobile Access
5. Storing records in Databse(TXT file)
6. Fully Customizable
7. Cost-effective
8. Reducing wastage of paper
9. Time Saving

## Cost and Features with Time
In order to determine the cost to develop library management system, a few aspects are to be considered first:

• Size of the App: More the features, more the cost.

• Number of Platforms: As the number of platforms are increased cost will also be increased significantly.

• If Indian App firm is chosen to create a IPL Management System then the cost can range between $5000-$8000. This estimate is when the system is being developed with basic features and for a single platform.
