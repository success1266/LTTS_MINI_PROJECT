INTRODUCTION TO THE INDIA PREMIER LEAGUE (IPL) :

Indian Premier League (IPL) is a famous cricket league that bids players to play domestic cricket in the country and encourage young and talented players. The new players though talented didn’t have a platform to showcase their achievements and get into the franchises. The BCCI (Indian cricket board) came up with a plan of building a website portal for the players to enter their details. The BCCI president Mr. Saurav Ganguly asked you to create a model class so that using your model class and the details, the web developers can get the data and feed them into their databases. So without any delay, let’s start working on our project.

The franchises in IPL are:

Sun Risers Hyderabad (SRH)
Chennai Super Kings (CSK)
Mumbai Indians (MI)
Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB)
Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)
Rajasthan Royals (RR)
Delhi Capitals (DC)
Kings XI Punjab (KXIP)

Cost and Features with Time
In order to determine the cost to develop library management system, a few aspects are to be considered first:

• Size of the App: More the features, more the cost.

• Number of Platforms: As the number of platforms are increased cost will also be increased significantly.

• If Indian App firm is chosen to create a IPL Management System then the cost can range between $5000-$8000. This estimate is when the system is being developed with basic features and for a single platform.
